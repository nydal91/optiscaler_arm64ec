## OptiScaler ARM64EC build for Winlator

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an **unofficial ARM64EC build** of [OptiScaler](https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler). Please report problems with it here, not to the OptiScaler team. Everything below this section is the upstream README.

**[Download the latest ARM64EC release](https://github.com/nydal91/optiscaler_arm64ec/releases/latest)**

This build lets x64 Windows games use OptiScaler on ARM devices. It works in **Winlator** on Android with an ARM64EC Wine, and it's also meant for Proton/Wine ARM64EC on Linux and Windows 11 on ARM. The normal x64 OptiScaler can't hook the ARM64EC system DLLs on these setups, so it crashes or does nothing.

### What it offers

- **ARM64EC OptiScaler proxy**, so the overlay, upscaler swapping and settings run in x64 games on ARM devices.
- **SGSR 1 and SGSR 2** (Snapdragon Game Super Resolution), added in this build as native backends for DX11, DX12 and Vulkan. They need no vendor runtime.
- **FSR on Adreno:** Vulkan and DX12 fixes for FSR 2 and FSR 3 in Winlator.
- **Unity Vulkan games on Turnip:** upscaling work is moved out of the render pass, because Turnip silently drops it there and the picture comes out blank.
- **OptiScaler overlay in Vulkan games** under Wine, where it couldn't open before because it never got the game window.
- **XeSS on DX12 with vkd3d-proton**, usable but slow on mobile GPUs.

### Tested in Winlator

Tested on a RedMagic 8 Pro (Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, Adreno 740) with the Winlator cmod fork, Proton 11 ARM64EC, FEXCore 2601, Turnip 26.2.0, DXVK 2.3.1 and vkd3d-proton 3.0.1. Games: Pumpkin Jack (DX11 and DX12) and Haste (Vulkan).

| Upscaler | Ini value | DX11 | DX12 | Vulkan |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SGSR 1 | `sgsr1` | Works | Works | Works |
| SGSR 2 | `sgsr2` | Works | Works | Works |
| FSR 2.1 | `fsr21` | Not available | Works | Works |
| FSR 2.2 | `fsr22` | Works | Works | Works |
| FSR 3 | `ffx` | Not tested (`fsr31`) | Works | Works |
| XeSS | `xess` | Intel GPUs only | Works, about 7 fps | Works |

- **Not working here:** `xess_12`, `fsr21_12` and `ffx_12`. These bridge modes need texture sharing that this setup doesn't provide.
- **Not available or not tested:** DLSS and FSR 4 aren't available on Adreno. Frame generation hasn't been tested.
- **SGSR 1** only looks at the current frame, so expect more aliasing and shimmer than from SGSR 2 or FSR.
- Testing covered two games on one phone, so other games and GPUs may behave differently.

### Install in Winlator

1. Use a container with an **ARM64EC Wine** build, such as `proton-11.0-1-arm64ec`, and DXVK + vkd3d as the graphics wrapper.
2. Extract the release zip and copy its contents into the folder with the game's real `.exe`. For Unreal Engine games that's usually `<Game>/Binaries/Win64/`.
3. Rename `OptiScaler.dll` to `dxgi.dll`.
4. Choose an upscaler in `OptiScaler.ini` with `Dx11Upscaler`, `Dx12Upscaler` or `VulkanUpscaler`.
5. **For Vulkan games**, also set `Vulkan=true` and `VulkanExtensionSpoofing=true`.
6. Start the game and turn on **DLSS** in its graphics settings. OptiScaler only runs when the game asks for DLSS, and some games turn the option off on every launch.

Press `O` to open the OptiScaler overlay. In Winlator, use a controls profile or on-screen keyboard that has an `O` key.

If OptiScaler doesn't load, add `WINEDLLOVERRIDES=dxgi=n,b` to the container's environment variables.

More detail is in [README-ARM64EC.md](arm64ec/README-ARM64EC.md), which is also in the zip. Don't use this with online games: anti-cheat systems may flag it.

## About

**OptiScaler** is a tool that lets you replace upscalers in games that ***already support DLSS2+ / FSR2+ / XeSS*** ($`^1`$), as well as manage ***frame generation*** in already mentioned games _(either by replacing existing FG options or enabling it in DX12 games through experimental ***OptiFG***)_. It also offers extensive customization options for all users, including those with Nvidia GPUs using DLSS.

> [!CAUTION]
> * We've been informed about some **FAKE websites** presenting themselves as OptiScaler team, so we would like to strongly highlight that we **DO NOT HAVE an official website!**  
> * We **DON'T have an official manager app**, so please be careful when downloading or using them! And please don't bother us to provide support for something which isn't even ours!
> * Only **LEGIT places** are this Github, our Discord server and Nitec's NexusMods page.  
> * OptiScaler is **FREE**, any kind of monetary requirements are scams!  

> [!TIP]
> _For example, if a game has DLSS only, OptiScaler can be used to replace DLSS with XeSS or FSR 3.1 (also works for FSR2-only games, like The Outer Worlds Spacer's Choice, albeit requires manually providing nvngx_dlss.dll)._

**Key aspects of OptiScaler:**
- Enables usage of XeSS, FSR2, FSR3, **FSR4**$`^2`$ (_officially, RDNA4 and RDNA3 dGPUs only_) and DLSS in (temporal) upscaler-enabled games
- Allows users to fine-tune their upscaling experience with a wide range of tweaks and enhancements (RCAS & MAS, Output Scaling, DLSS Presets, Ratio & DRS Overrides etc.)
- Since v0.7.0+, added ***experimental DX12*** frame generation support with possible HUDfix solution ([**OptiFG**](#optifg--hudfix-experimental-hud-ghosting-fix))
- Supports [**Fakenvapi**](#installation) integration - enables Reflex hooking and injecting _Anti-Lag 2_ (RDNA1+ only), _LatencyFlex_ (LFX) or _XeLL_ - _bundled since 0.9_  
- Since v0.7.7, added support for **Nukem's** FSR3-FG mod [**dlssg-to-fsr3**](#installation), only supports games with ***native DLSS-FG*** - _bundled since 0.9_
- Since v0.7.8, added **ASI plugin loading** support (_disabled_ by default (`LoadAsiPlugins=` in INI), loads from customisable folder, default `plugins`)
- New project - [**OptiPatcher**](https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiPatcher) - an ASI Plugin for OptiScaler for enabling DLSS and DLSSG inputs without spoofing in ***supported games***.
- Since v0.7.8, OptiScaler is now automatically applying certain game patches for a better out-of-the-box experience
- Since v0.9.0, separated FG Inputs and Outputs, added XeFG and FSR4-FG support, as well as bundled Fakenvapi and Nukem's FSR3-FG mod
- For a detailed list of all features, check [Features](Features.md)


> [!IMPORTANT]
> _**Always check the [Wiki Compatibility list](https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler/wiki) for known game issues and workarounds.**_  
> Also please check the  [***OptiScaler known issues***](#known-issues) at the end regarding **RTSS** compatibility.  
> A separate [***FSR4 Compatibility list***](https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler/wiki/FSR4-Compatibility-List) is available for community-sourced tested games.  
> ***[3]** For **not bundled** items, please check [Installation](#installation).*  

> [!NOTE]
> ### Upscaler notes
> <details>
>  <summary><b>Click for [1], [2] </b></summary>  
>  
> **[1]** For **Unreal Engine** games, only UE XeSS -> Opti XeSS/FSR4 work  
>  
> *Regarding **XeSS** inputs, since **Unreal Engine plugin** does not provide depth, replacing in-game XeSS breaks other upscalers (e.g. Redout 2 as a XeSS-only game), but you can still apply RCAS sharpening to XeSS to reduce blurry visuals.* 
>
> *Regarding **FSR inputs**, FSR 3.1 is the first version with a fully standardised, forward-looking API and should be fully supported. Since FSR2 and FSR3 support custom interfaces, game support will depend on the developers' implementation. With Unreal Engine games, you might need [ini tweaks](https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler/wiki/Unreal-Engine-Tweaks) for FSR inputs.*  
>
> **[2]** *Regarding **FSR4**, please check [FSR4 Compatibility list](https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler/wiki/FSR4-Compatibility-List) for known supported games and general info.*

## Official Discord Server: [OptiScaler](https://discord.gg/wEyd9w4hG5)

*This project is based on [PotatoOfDoom](https://github.com/PotatoOfDoom)'s excellent [CyberFSR2](https://github.com/PotatoOfDoom/CyberFSR2).*

## How it works?
* OptiScaler acts as a middleware, it intercepts upscaler calls from the game (_**Inputs**_) and redirects them to the chosen upscaling backend (_**Output**_), allowing user to replace one technology with another one. **Inputs -> OptiScaler -> Outputs**  
* _Or put more bluntly, **Input** is the upscaler used in game settings, and **Output** the one selected in Opti Overlay._
* _Same goes for FG options which are separated into **FG Input** and **FG Output**._

> [!NOTE]
> * Pressing **`Insert`** should open the Optiscaler **Overlay** in-game with all of the options (_`ShortcutKey=` can be changed in the INI file, or under **Keybinds** in the overlay_). 
> * Pressing **`Page Up`** shows the performance stats overlay in the top left, and can be cycled between different modes with **`Page Down`** (_keybinds customisable in the overlay_).  
> * If Opti overlay is instantly disappearing after trying Insert a few times, maybe try **`Alt + Insert`** ([reported workaround](https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler/issues/484) for alternate keyboard layouts).

## Which APIs and Upscalers are Supported?
Currently **OptiScaler** can be used with DirectX 11, DirectX 12 and Vulkan, but each API has different sets of supported upscalers.  
[**OptiFG**](#optifg--hudfix-experimental-hud-ghosting-fix) currently **only supports DX12** and is explained in a separate paragraph.

#### For DirectX 12
- XeSS (Default)
- FSR 2.1.2, 2.2.1
- FSR 3.X (and FSR 2.3.X)
- FSR 4.X (via FSR 3.X/4, _officially RDNA4 and RDNA3 dGPUs only_)
- DLSS

#### For DirectX 11
- FSR 2.2.1 (Default, native DX11)
- FSR 3.1.2 (unofficial port to native DX11)
- DLSS (native DX11)
- XeSS 2.X (native DX11, _Intel ARC only_)
- XeSS, FSR 2.1.2, 2.2.1, FSR 3.X w/Dx12 (_via D3D11on12_)$`^1`$
- FSR 4.X (via FSR 3.X/4 w/Dx12 interop, _officially RDNA4 and RDNA3 dGPUs only_)

> [!NOTE]
> <details>
>  <summary><b>Expand for [1]</b></summary>
>
> _**[1]** These implementations use a background DirectX12 device to be able to use DX12-only upscalers. There's a performance penalty up to 10-ish % for this method, but allows many more upscaler options. Also native DX11 implementation of FSR 2.2.1 is a backport from Unity renderer and has its own problems of which some were fixed by OptiScaler._
> </details>

#### For Vulkan
- FSR 4.X (via FSR 3.X/4 w/Dx12 interop, _officially RDNA4 and RDNA3 dGPUs only_)
- FSR2 2.1.2 (Default), 2.2.1
- FSR3 3.1 (and FSR2 2.3.2)
- DLSS
- XeSS 2.x

#### OptiFG + HUDfix (experimental HUD ghosting fix) 
**OptiFG** was added with **v0.7** and is **only supported in DX12**. 
It's an **experimental** way of adding FG to games without native Frame Generation, or can also be used as a last case scenario if the native FG is not working properly.  
* Currently supports FSR3-FG (requires HUDfix to avoid HUD ghosting), XeFG and FSR4-FG (ML model deals with the HUD, so may or may not require HUDfix).
